## Overview

The Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) provides gridded gauge-analysis products derived from quality controlled station data.
There are different products available; we only downloaded the full reanalysis.
The latest version of the full reanalysis is V2020
[monthly](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/GPCC/html/fulldata-monthly_v2020_doi_download.html) and
[daily](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/GPCC/html/fulldata-daily_v2020_doi_download.html)
that covers from 1891 to 2019.

The data is available on 4 global grids for monthly and only at 1.0 degrees resolution for daily:
- 0.25 degree latitude x 0.25 degree longitude global grid (1440 x 720) - only monthly
- 0.5 degree latitude x 0.5 degree longitude global grid (720 x 360) - only monthly
- 1.0 degree latitude x 1.0 degree longitude global grid (360 x 180)
- 2.5 degree latitude x 2.5 degree longitude global grid (144 x 72) - only monthly

The data is not bias-corrected for gauges errors,
but estimates on these are also provided.
More information and a visualization tool for the dataset is available on the
[GPCC website](https://www.dwd.de/EN/ourservices/gpcc/gpcc.html).
For a review of the data check the
[UCAR Climate Data Guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/gpcc-global-precipitation-climatology-centre).
The data was downloaded from the [GPCC data server](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/GPCC/).

## Data location

We've downloaded GPCC data to,

```
/g/data/ia39/gpcc/replica/data/<version>/<frequency>/<grid>/<files>
```
where `<version>` is:
- `V1`: daily data only on 1.0 X 1.0 degree grid
- `V6`: monthly data only on a 0.5 X 0.5 degree grid from 1901 to 2010
- `V7`: monthly data only on 0.5 X 0.5 and 2.5 X 2.5 degrees grid from 1901 to 2013
- `V2018`: on 4 grids for monthly and 1.0 X 1.0 grid for daily (as for V2020), from 1891 to 2016
- `V2020`: full dataset as described in overview 

`<frequency>` is:
- `mon`
- `day`

`<grid>` is:
- `025` for 0.25 x 0.25
- `05` for 0.5 x 0.5
- `10` for 1.0 x 1.0
- `25` for 2.5 x 2.5
